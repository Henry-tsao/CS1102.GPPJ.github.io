  <h2>How HTTPS Secures the Internet</h2>
  <p>HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secured version of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to digitally sign the data transmission and encrypt the data transmission between the request side and the response side. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.</p >
  <h2>Features of HTTP & HTTPS</h2>
  <h3>HTTP</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support client/server mode.</li>
    <li>Simple and fast: When customers request services from the server, they only need to request a method and path. Common request methods include GET, HEAD, and POST.</li>
    <li>Flexible: HTTP allows data objects of any type to be transmitted.</li>
    <li>Connectionless: Only one request can be processed per connection.</li>
    <li>Stateless: HTTP is a stateless protocol. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>HTTPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Content encryption: The content from the browser to server is transmitted in encrypted form, and the intermedary cannot directly view the original content.</li>
    <li>Authentication: By establishing an SSL(Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS(Transport Layer Security) secure channel between the client browser and the Web server, the transmitted data is encrypted and hidden. Ensure that data is not tampered or stolen during transmission, and ensure data integrity and security.</li>
    <li>Data integrity: Prevent content from being impersonated or tampered with by third parties.</li>
    <li>HTTPS is considered a basic requirement that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect sensitive information like login credentials and credit card details from unauthorized access.</li>
    <li>HTTPS is indicated by a padlock icon in the web browser's address bar and the "https://" prefix in the website's URL.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTPS: Bank account login, any website that requires user login.</li>
    <li>HTTP: Transmitting HTML documents, pictures, videos, etc.</li>
  </ul>
